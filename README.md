# Implementation Approach

This multi-step form solution was built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Shadcn UI**, prioritizing type safety, modularity, and user experience. Hereâ€™s how I tackled it:

---

## Dynamic Architecture

- Fields are configured in a **centralized array** with **Zod validation schemas**
- **Total steps** are calculated dynamically from the `page` property of fields
- **Form state and validation** are managed via **react-hook-form + Zod** integration

---

## UI/UX Focus

- Implemented **responsive dark/light mode** with **persistent local storage**
- Added **animated success feedback** and **accessible labels**
- Designed a **progress stepper** that auto-updates based on steps

---

## Key Features

- **Smart Validation**: Only validates current step fields
- **Reusable Components**: `FormField` dynamically renders inputs based on type
- **Error Handling**: Zod provides clear, contextual error messages
- **Security**: Password matching via schema refinement

---

## Extensibility

- Fields can be added/removed by modifying the **fields array**
- New input types supported by **extending `FormField` logic**
- **Theme system** allows easy visual customization

---

> The solution balances **developer experience** (clean, type-safe code) with **end-user experience** (smooth navigation, clear feedback).
